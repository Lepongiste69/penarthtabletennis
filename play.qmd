Our weekly sessions are designed to be inclusive of everyone, whether playing leisurely or competitively. Our coach is available to provide advice.

We normally play on a Friday evenings from 5.30pm until 6.45pm. We break for half term but we play over the summer. There may be other small variations due to the varying availability of the hall. Please see the table below for the detail. Join the club's WhatsApp group (see the "contact us" page) for regular reminders.

We are open to all adults and motivated, supervised children aged 12 and over. New joiners are welcome to simply turn up at the session of their choice. We can supply all the equipment required, including lending bats. If you have a question before joining, please see the "contact us" page.
