title: "Play"

Our weekly sessions are designed to be inclusive of everyone, whether playing leisurely or competitively. Our coach is available to provide advice.

We normally play on a Friday from 6-7.30pm. We break for half term but we play over the summer. There may be other small variations due to the varying availability of the hall. Please see the table below for the detail. Join the club's WhatsApp group (see the "contact us" page) for regular reminders.
